          <h2>Build, analyze and edit smooth color palettes</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://palettte.app">Palettte App</a> is a tool I built in
            order to learn react and solve a specific problem I had when working
            on our color palettes at <Link to="/lifetime">LifeTime</Link>.<br />
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Why yet another color palette tool?</h3>
          <p>
            Most existing apps generate new color schemes based on different
            geometrical concepts such as complementary colors or colors that are
            layed out in a triangle or another shape in a certain color space.
          </p>
          <p>
            The resulting color schemes might be suitable for logos or classic
            graphic design, but they rarely work for UI Design, where most of
            the time you need to work with a few base colors (that are often set
            by brand guidelines) and a whole range of different variations and
            shades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Steve Schoger describes the creation of such a color palette quite
            well:
            <br />
            <a href="https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/">
              Building your color palette
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Another great article about this is from Eric Kennedy:
            <br />
            <a href="https://learnui.design/blog/color-in-ui-design-a-practical-framework.html">
              Color in UI Design - a practical Framework
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            What Steve doesn't describe exactly is how he finds those colors:
            <i>
              "...you just need to fill in the gaps in between", "Trust your
              eyes, not the numbers."
            </i>
          </p>

          <p>This is where palettte app comes into play:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Build <b>smooth color schemes</b> that flow from one color to
              another
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Finetune hue, saturation value gradients</b> of your palette
              and of each color swatch individually
            </li>
            <li>
              Import, analyze and <b>edit existing color schemes</b>, find
              errors or automatically find the most similar colors from a new
              palette to a list of legacy colors from your codebase
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h3>Building a new color palette</h3>
          <p>
            To create a new color palette, click on the plus icon in the left
            sidebar and delete all sample colors by clicking on backspace. You
            can now add your base color by clicking "add swatch" or hitting the
            spacebar and entering the HEX-Value in the right sidebar.
          </p>
          <p>
            When adding more swatches you can see that three curves form: one
            for the hue, one for the saturation and one for the value
            (=brightness) of the colors.
          </p>
          <LargeImage src={PalettteImage2} />
          <p>
            A basic palette for UI Design consists of 8-10 shades where the hue
            stays the same for all shades, the value goes up and the saturation
            goes down <b>smoothly</b> as the colors get lighter.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Analyzing and editing existing color palettes</h3>
          <p>
            If you already have a color palette and you want to know if it can
            be optimized, import the colors one by one or write the palette down
            in the special JSON format (example can be seen whan clicking on
            import) and batch import your palette.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the palette Steve Schoger uses in his example in Refactoring
            UI:
          </p>
          <LargeImage src={PalettteImage3} />
          <p>
            As you can see there is a little ditch in the value envelope curve
            and the saturation curve is round in the beginning and falls off in
            a linear way suddenly, nothing too serious but it's clear that Steve
            has chosen his colors by "trusting his eyes" and not his numbers ;).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can edit lines by dragging the handles around or by selecting
            two handles and clicking on "interpolate" (only linear interpolation
            is supported at the moment).
          </p>
          <LargeImage src={PalettteImage4} />
          <p>
            When you are happy with your result, simply export your new colors
            again.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Mapping old colors to new ones</h3>
          <p>
            You will often somehow find yourself in a situation where you have
            built a wonderful new color palette, but your legacy code does not
            reflect the beauty of it as a lot of different shades and colors
            have piled up over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            With palettte app, you can import those (legacy) colors and find the
            most similar colors from your new palettes automatically. You will
            also immediatly spot when colors are too far off, and you need to
            introduce more colors in your palettes.
          </p>
          <LargeImage src={PalettteImage1} />
          <p>
            It can also be useful if you want to add shades to your palette and
            need to rename all existing colors.
          </p>
