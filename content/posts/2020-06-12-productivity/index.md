The productivity hacks which I've been lately using lately to get more done!

### Introduction

Productivity has always been a major issue. In a world where everything is moving faster and faster, this is even more true today. Thus, everyone is looking to increase their productivity on a daily basis. The goal is to be super efficient in a minimum of time in order to be able to do more things or, and this is my advice, to have more time for yourself.

Here are my top Productivity hacks that I'm using for the past 6 months:

### 1. Always have a Sticky note around.

Writing down your todos in your sticky notes is a good way of reminding yourself of the tasks you need to perform on that day. I usually write down or create a mind map of the task I need to get done on that day and prioritize them. And another plus point is, when you have that window of inspiration for a task, you can easily jot it down for further exploration.

### 2. Smallest task first!

Starting your day off with a small win sets the tone for an entire day. I generally do designing in the morning as it's an easy win for me and an initial 30-40mins of designing gets my right brain juiced up. So pick the smallest task that you have in hand and work on getting it done! It all comes down to prioritizing in the end.

### 3. Push yourself to begin.

Staring out on a task is half the battle won! With so many new distractions coming up everyday it's hard to push yourself to work when you've got a series to binge. Time is a valuable asset. A series takes about 9-13 hours to binge, and if you had invested that time working on getting things done, you would have saved 4 hours of work and 2 hours of Panic eating!

### 4. Procrastination is good.

Procrastination could be a friend or foe for you. For me it's a friend and many of my inspirations when it comes to design have come through procrastinating for a task. Your Subconscious mind helps you a lot when you're procrastinating, give it a chance to help you in your work.
