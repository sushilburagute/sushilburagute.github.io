# How barrier to code has fallen over the years

Let me start off with an example:

Setting up an React development environment pre-2017

Step 1: Generate a package.json file.
Step 2: Install React and React DOM.
Step 3: Install Webpack.
Step 4: Install Babel.
Step 5: Create index.html, App.js, main.js, webpack.config.js and.babelrc.
Step 6: Configure your webpack-config.js , package.json and .babelrc
Step 7:Run the server and generate the bundle!

Setting up an React development environment post-2017

Step 1: npx create-react-app app-name
Step 2: Run the project. You're good to go!

So 7 steps have been condensed into 2 steps. The point which stands out here is, the barrier to entry for coding has fallen. Since the leaps in computation and advancements in technology and emergence of new roles, the internet saw a bust since the 2000s and hasn’t slowed down yet.

If you had to learn how to code back in the 80s or 90s, most likely you needed a Phd or a degree at the least to know the inner working of the computer. But due to the Information age, just one person, with a connection to youtube can easily get started with the wide variety of concepts and possibly land a job! And as more and more devs are emerging on platforms such as youtube, udemy, etc it won’t be long until we see the barrier to code is non-existent!

The major reason I see this shift is due to open source, tech communities of people coming together and helping young devs be better in their field which in turn has caused the domino effect to kick in! And oh boy, hasn’t coding become easy and popular?!
And as long as we keep pushing open source, we as a community will motivate others to learn the language of the future and will provide a medium to communicate with the 'Number cruncher'.
