`“Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services — servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and more — over the Internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage, similar to how you are billed for water or electricity at home.” (Microsoft Azure)`

Whether you’re tweeting about the newest JS library or looking up help up on stackoverflow, there’s a cloud at play to help back up the platforms. A cloud as a concept has taken off recently, but it has gotten mature way quicker than other technologies.

## The Big Picture

The biggest advantage I see is, you don’t need to invest in your own hardware, security and management of the servers. Instead of setting up all the servers by yourself, the cloud has automated the task of setting all of that up!

Cherry on the top you ask? Cloud computing provides an easy way to access servers, storage, databases and a full range of application services over the Internet. Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform have excellent documentation and tons of community support to help you in every step of the process.

And oh! You get updates to the latest hardware, security patches, speed and agility, flexible capacity for a cost of minimal. Never in history has making a Full-stack become so easy.

## Conclusion

If you don’t have ‘learning the cloud’ on your bucket list, I highly suggest you add it! Because it’s going to be an essential skill the way I see it, given the terms like ‘big-data’, ‘AI/ML’ etc are going around.
